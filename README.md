# Saikat Gharami

I build full-stack systems with a level of clarity and discipline that most fresh developers don't even aim for.  
I don’t copy tutorials. I don’t chase trends.  
I build **real products** with **real architecture** that can be deployed, scaled, and maintained.

My work reflects exactly what companies want in a MERN engineer:
- Reliable authentication flows (JWT + HTTP-only cookies)
- Clean backend logic with proper routing, middlewares, and validation
- Efficient MongoDB models designed for real-world usage
- Frontend systems that are fast, responsive, and component-driven
- State management that doesn’t turn into a mess (Zustand / Redux)

If you're looking for someone who can take a feature from idea → design → backend → frontend → deploy,  
I already do that. Every day.
